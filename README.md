# 3D-with-CSS---tech-talk

This is my third tech talk. In my free time I played with modeling an actual box with actual pages. Till now I alway used flat cube surfaces so wanted to explore how to do it with CSS only. Result did not disapoint! This was really fun project and I did not know that you can do that much and reproduce so much realistic 3D surrounding with just pure HTML and CSS, no scripts at all. Inspiration for this project and actual tutorials I followed are from developer Amit Sheen who has amazing CodePens https://codepen.io/amit_sheen/pens/public?cursor=ZD0xJm89MCZwPTEmdj01MjM5MzkzNw== and YouTuber CSS king Kevin Powell https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdftnCDwKaU&t=882s&ab_channel=KevinPowellKevinPowellVerified.
